# EvolutionaryPathFinder

A simulated recreation of Darwinâ€™s Theory of
Evolution by Natural Selection with Autonomous Vehicles to see which agent performs the
best results. Genetic Algorithms and Neural Networks which adopt similar traits to this
theory are great concepts that could be applied to this experiment. This paper analyses the
results of how various vehicle traits can affect a race line.
